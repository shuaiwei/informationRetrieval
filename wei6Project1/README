Function: Three index files can be produced in each directory.
		  Search interface for searching on palmetto.
		  Uniword, Biword search can be made. 

Operations:
	In order to operate in another virtual machine, 4 things are need to be done:
		1) All my directories, UniP1, BiP1, PosP1 and Search need to be put in a same parent directory, such as /home/wei6.

		2) Create a "data" directory in the same parent directory, which put input Zip files; 

		3) Modify the software installing path in "runHadoop.pbs" in all my 4 project directories;

		4) Modify the configure path for hadoop and java in "run.bash" in all my 4 project directories to make us run Makefile directly and generate .jar file.

	Steps:
	1) Producing index files: (in current directory "output" named "part-r-0000")

		Execute "./run.bash" in  directories UniP1, BiP1 and PosP1, then files will be compiled, .jar file and be produced and task will be submitted to palmetto.

	2) Search
		Execute "./search.bash", after compiling and run, a user-friendly interface will show up. Then we can input search type and corresponding term by the hint. At last, searching result from palmetto will be printed on terminal.
