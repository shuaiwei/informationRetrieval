230757	230757	Volkswagen AG has increased its stake in its small Polish subisidiary by buying shares from the Polish Development Bank (PBR), the bank said on Tuesday. It said in a statement that PBR sold Volkswagen more than 1.5 million shares in the venture, called  Volkswagen Poznan Sp. z o.o. and based near the western city of Poznan, for more than six million marks. As a result Volkswagen's stake in the company increased to 87.8 percent from 71.9 percent. A Volkswagen official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters the purchase was connected to the German firm's expansion plans in Poland.

23461	23461	Five years after Volkswagen AG dropped its head-scratching "Fahrvergnugen" ad slogan, the German automaker has finally found a way to reconnect with car buyers hungry for something different. Volkswagen, enjoying a sales rebound this year, now markets itself to younger buyers on a budget. Ads feature wide-angle camera shots of twentysomethings and their Weimaraner dogs, Trek mountain bikes and the 1960s cartoon icon, Speed Racer. The year-old "Drivers Wanted" campaign has struck a chord, and sales, up more than 14 percent this year through July, should be the strongest since 1988 for Volkswagen in the United States. Steve Wilhite, senior marketing executive for Volkswagen of America Inc., expects sales to reach 140,000 units. That would be up 22 percent from 115,114 in 1995, and the highest since 168,800 vehicles were sold in 1988. Volkswagen, which ranks as the fourth-largest automaker in the world, has always cultivated a unique, quirky image among the American public. But "Fahrvergnugen," which means the "pleasure of driving," failed to convey that. Then came problems at Volkswagen's Pueblo, Mexico, assembly plant starting in 1992. For 18 months introduction of key new models was delayed, and sales plunged to under 50,000 units in 1993. That's a far cry from 1970, when U.S. Volkswagen sales peaked at 569,696 cars and vans. In the fall of 1994, Volkswagen slashed 43 percent of its North American sales and marketing staff and consolidated U.S. and Canadian operations at its Auburn Hills, Mich., complex. Now back on its feet with freshened products, Volkswagen plans a series of overhauls to its U.S. offerings through the year 2000. Next spring it will introduce an all-new version of its Passat. In 1998, the U.S. is expected to get a new Jetta and the much-awaited successor to the beloved Beetle. Volkswagen could introduce some other "surpises" before 2000, but none will be in the hottest U.S. market segment -- sport/utility vehicles -- said Wilhite. Volkswagen officials predict it can boost annual U.S. sales as much as 20 percent. Wilhite is enthusiastic about Volkswagen's sales momentum, believing it brings customers back to a rich heritage, a time when Beetle drivers passing on isolated highways would flash their lights in greeting. "The key for us is really taking wonderful products that offer a very real experiential difference from our Japanese and domestic competitors and effectively communicating to the market who we are and why we deserve considering," he said. Indeed, Volkswagen car buyers get a vehicle with a distinct personality. Seats are made with a "rising ramp" construction. Although providing strong ergonomic support, they initially feel like flat boards compared to seats in many cars made by Detroit's Big Three automakers. And American buyers, who have developed high cupholder expectations, may be disappointed with the Jetta. The top-selling Volkswagen U.S. vehicle offers two Dixie-cup sized holders, a far cry from the versatile claw-like system found in a Chrysler Corp. minivan. Dealers and analysts credit Volkswagnen's turnaround to more consistent management. They also said the "Drivers Wanted" campaign, created by the Boston advertising agency of Arnold Fortuna Lawner & Cabot, has positioned Volkswagen as the automaker of choice for active, young individuals. Bob Lewis, whose San Jose, Calif., Volkswagen dealership was the largest in the United States last year, said he was seeing first-time buyers that were previously lost to the Japanese. Bringing those people in are attractive leases offering new cars for about $200 a month. Art Spinella, who runs CNW Marketing Research in Bandon, Ore., said lease sales rose 50 percent to about 38 percent of total sales in the first half. Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates auto consultants, said Volkswagen's prediction of up to 20 percent annual sales growth may be optimistic. She said the company's niche in the middle to low end of the market could make it vulnerable to the rising popularity of some used cars. But she said the new Beetle will inject a fresh sense of style into the Volkswagen brand image. "I think the new Beetle will have a broad appeal across age groups," she said.

247092	247092	Standard & Poor's said on Tuesday it affirmed its A plus corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings and the A1 commercial paper rating of Volkswagen AG and related entities. "The outlook is stable," S&P said in a statement.   "With respect to the ongoing litigation between General Motors and Volkswagen, the potential exists for a significant monetary settlement or court judgment which could impact existing ratings," S&P said. But it added that the likelihood, amount and possible timing of either a settlement or a decision to award damages could not be assessed at this time, and ratings currently made no assumption regarding the outcome of pending litigation.   S&P said Volkswagen's ratings continued to reflect its position as the leading European automotive volume manufacturer and the strength of its financial profile. "In the face of an increasingly competitive marketplace and with profitability impacted by high German labour costs, Volkswagen continues to take steps to improve its competitive position," it said. S&P said it was confident the effectiveness of cost cutting measures and results of future model programmes will support the sustainability of Volkswagen's current ratings, but questions existed over potential litigation-related pay-outs.

276840	276840	Volkswagen Group Japan KK (Volkswagen Japan), the Japanese unit of Volkswagen AG, hopes to boost its Japanese sales of Volkswagen and Audi AG cars to about 70,000 units in calendar 1997, a spokeswoman for Volkswagen Japan said on Thursday. Its sales in Japan for 1996 are expected to reach 60,000 cars, up sharply from 45,774 in 1995. The spokesman also said Volkswagen would cut the sticker prices in Japan of its Golf GIT16V, Golf VR6, Golf Cabriolet and VW Vento VR6 models, at the higher end of its Golf and Vento series, by 5.5 to 9.7 percent, effective on January 1. The price reduction partly reflects a drop in distribution costs due to robust sales of the Golf Wagon and Polo models recently introduced in Japan.
299919	299919	Standard & Poor's said on Friday it affirmed its A plus corporate credit, senior unsecured and A1 commercial paper ratings of Volkswagen AG and related entities. "The outlook is stable," S&P said in a statement. At the same time, S&P assigned its A plus rating to the $250 million guaranteed exchangeable notes of Volkswagen International Finance N.V. The notes are exchangeable for ordinary bearer shares of Volkswagen AG, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Volkswagen AG (A plus senior unsecured debt). S&P said this rating outlook was also stable.   Volkswagen International Finance NV, Amsterdam, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG.

S&P said it acknowledged the recent announcement by Volkswagen and General Motors that litigation issues between the two parties have been settled. "The one time payment by Volkswagen AG of $100 million and an agreement, which is under negotiation to purchase parts from General Motors in the amount of $1.0 billion over a period of seven years have no ratings impact," said S&P.

300319	300319	Following are transcripts of letters sent between General Motors Corp and Volkswagen AG to end their nearly four-year-old legal dispute over allegations of industrial spying. The two carmakers announced terms of the out-of-court settlement on Thursday. Both letters are dated January 9, 1997. The settlement calls for VW to pay GM $100 million, buy some $1 billion worth of car parts over a seven-year period and retract statements made about the U.S. carmaker. In return, GM has agreed to drop all civil litigation against VW, including its racketeering lawsuit filed in a Detroit federal court, which had threatened VW with a potential jury verdict payout in the billions of dollars. VOLKSWAGEN LETTER TO GM: Mr. John G. Smale Member, Board of Directors General Motors Corporation Mr. John F. Smith Jr. Chairman of the Board General Motors Corporation Gentlemen: This letter is part of our agreement to settle the civil disputes between Volkswagen AG on one side and General Motors Corporation and Adam Opel AG on the other side. We confirm that Volkswagen has accepted the resignation of Messrs. Lopez and Gutierrez as of November 29, 1996. Messrs. Alvarez and Piazza will resign or take administrative leave no later than by the end of January 1997. The indictment of Messrs. Lopez, Gutierrez, Alvarez and Piazza brought by the Darmstadt prosecutor in December 1996 alleges illegal activities which are presently in front of a German court. Therefore, Volkswagen acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven. Volkswagen understands GM/Opel's concerns with respect to possible wrongdoing by the indicted individuals. Volkswagen also respects, however, the constitutional right of these individuals to be considered innocent until proven guilty. You have informed us that GM/Opel's commencement of legal actions or public statements were not designed to harm Volkswagen's image or to defame Volkswagen or its executives. We accept this clarification and rescind any statements we have made to the contrary. Volkswagen regrets any statements that have been interpreted to suggest that GM/Opel had planted or fabricated evidence. We do not believe that GM/Opel's actions constituted an attack on Germany as an industrial location. Volkswagen is pleased that this letter and the actions taken allow us to bring the civil disputes to an end. We regret, as we understand GM does, that there has been such a public escalation of our disputes. The agreement reached between GM/Opel and Volkswagen creates future business opportunities for both sides, while remaining competitors in the automotive industry. Signed Dr Klaus Liesen Dr Ferdinand Piech GM LETTER TO VOLKSWAGEN Dr Klaus Liesen Chairman, Board of Supervisors Volkswagen AG Dr Ferdinand Piech Chairman, Board of Management Volkswagen AG Gentlemen: This letter responds to the letter you have sent us as part of our agreement to settle and resolve the civil disputes which our management has had with Volkswagen's management over the Lopez affair. It is regrettable, as you indicate, that this dispute between our companies escalated to such a great degree. Circumstances required that we avail ourselves of the United States civil law causes of action. We have directed our counsel to dismiss the charges made against Dr Piech and Dr Neumann and, pursuant to the terms of our agreement, to dismiss our complaint against the rest of the defendants as well. Our civil complaint against Volkswagen and some of your executives did not constitute criminal charges. We will continue to cooperate fully with the public prosecutors as requested by them. General Motors and Opel necessarily will abide by and respect the judgements of the prosecutors and the outcome of their investigations and proceedings. We are pleased that Volkswagen has acknowledged the legitimacy of our concerns and that our companies have found a satisfactory basis for the resolution of our outstanding civil disputes. We look forward to a future unencumbered by the legacy of this matter. Sincerely, John G. Smale John F Smith --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
311853	311853	Volkswagen Asia Pacific Ltd, a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, is forecasting sales of more than 400,000 units in the region in 1997, compared to 335,342 units in 1996, senior company officers told Reuters on Thursday.   "We are expecting in 1997 more than 400,000 units to be sold throughout Asia," said Martin Posth, chairman and president of Volkswagen Asia-Pacific and a Volkswagen AG management board member. "Sales volume in the whole region increased to 335,342 cars through the end of 1996 after 295,000 units in 1995, an increase of 13.5 percent," Posth said in an interview in Hong Kong. Sales in China are the most difficult to forecast, Posth said. This is apparently because of the growing price competition among domestic car manufactururs and from imports.   "To be on the safe side, we expect 200,000 unit sales from Shanghai Volkswagen, and for FAW Volkswagen Ltd 40,000 cars," said Posth. Shanghai Volkswagen is a manufacturing joint venture with Shanghai Automobile Industrial Corp, while FAW Volkswagen is a joint venture with First Automotive Corp, China's largest vehicle manufacturer. Up to the end of 1996, the sales of Volkswagen and Audi models in China rose to 239,846 units, including some 4,600 imported cars, compared with 219,431 the previous year, the company said in a statement issued on Thursday.   Volkswagen's production at its two joint venture plants accounted for about 61.5 percent of total Chinese domestic passenger car production in 1996, the statement said. The company is also forecasting growth in unit sales to Japan to rise to more than 70,000 this year, Posth said. Volkswagen, which sells Volkswagen and Audi models to Japan, recorded sales of 59,045 units in 1996, up 31.6 percent. This meant an improvement in marketshare among imports, excluding imports from Japanese overseas transplants, to 18.9 percent versus 17.2 percent in 1995, the company statement said.   The Volkswagen brand maintained its position as the number one imported brand in Japan, it said. The company said the biggest growth in 1996 was seen in Thailand with 6,522 units sold versus 3,816 units in the year earlier, an increase of 70.9 percent. In Taiwan, the company recorded sales growth of 6.1 percent to 17,078 units in 1996 from 16,089 units in 1995, the statement said. -- Kathleen Kearney (852) 2843 6933
459593	459593	Volkswagen AG's Volkswagen of America Inc, the importer of Audi and Volkswagen vehicles, said Friday it again would import vehicles through the Port of Wilmington, Del. Volkswagen had closed a Wilmington facility last year in a streamlining move, but it said it determined that increased sales and new distribution methods required more capacity.

493742	493742	Sales of Volkswagen vehicles soared in China in March with heavy demand from government agencies and taxi companies, the company said in a statement issued from Hong Kong on Tuesday. Shanghai Volkswagen reported sales of 20,331 vehicles in March while FAW-Volkswagen in northeastern Changchun sold 4,228 cars, the company said. Sales of the Shanghai joint venture were now up by 27.8 percent compared with the same period in 1996, while sales from the Changchun joint venture were 88.7 percent up on the year-ago period, it said. Shanghai Volkswagen delivered 55,254 of its Santana sedans in the first three months while FAW-Volkswagen delivered 8,945 of its Jetta sedan, both outperforming Chinese domestic market growth, it said. "Strong demand from government agencies and taxi firms propelled sales at Shanghai Volkswagen, while FAW-Volkswagen felt the effects of the wider availability of the new Jetta GL and 20-valve Jetta GT models," it said.
